# OSM-image-archiver
## A quick project I threw togeher which has 2 scripts:

### [imgur_taginfo_to_url_list.py](imgur_taginfo_to_url_list.py)

Downloads all imgur links from Openstreetmap's Taginfo and saves to a txt file.
  
### [Download images via IMGURuls.txt file.sh](Download%20images%20via%20IMGURuls.txt%20file.sh)
Downloads the images that are in the txt file from the previous script

## Snapshot of all images:

[Snapshot of all IMGUR **urls** as of 2023 08 30.txt](Snapshot%20of%20all%20IMGUR%20**urls**%20as%20of%202023%2008%2030.txt)

And here you can download the actual images (DO NOTE: I myself am not giving permission to use these images. Some of them have/had licenses on their respective Imgur pages which say what license applies to each one)

https://drive.proton.me/urls/R5QK4H0EF4#WTzkkxAGYxwF

The amount of files is lower than the actual .txt file, because some urls were simply broken or deleted on Imgur's servers.
